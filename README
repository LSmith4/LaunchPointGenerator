Code for global optimization of continuous nonlinear programs.

Constraint Consensus concentrates random start points. Single linkage clustering identifies the most promising launch points for a local solver. The critical distance for clustering is found with a routine that analyzes the inter-point distance frequency distribution of the concentrated points.

The suggested launch points are output to /tmp/launchPoints.data.

The code is dependent on the Ampl Solver Library (ASL).
